# predictive_modeling
read csv files using pandas.
You can start with whichever you prefer.
What I will need in the end is a pandas dataframe with the following columns(in no particular order):
   - machine_id
   - model 
   - age
   - voltage
   - rotate
   - pressure
   - vibration
   - error 1
   .
   .
   - error 5
   - comp1_fail
   .
   .
   - comp4_fail
   - comp1_maint
   .
   .
   - comp4_maint


UPDATE as of 3/21/2024
from MICHAEL - I uploaded the final data frame comprised of the columns that you asked for. 
               I also uploaded the code I used to transform the data sets into one.
               I used Google colab to run the code, you may need to edit the directories if you want to use the code yourself as I just uploaded the csv files directly to the notebook.
